WPP-17 Updating the web proxy portlet to use HttpClient 4.0-beta2.  This update includes significant refactoring required by the HttpClient 4 API.  We've also updated the database persistence code to save a list of cookies rather than the lob-encoded serialized State (which no longer exists as of HttpClient 4).  The HttpClient object is now stored in the user session instead of the State object.
